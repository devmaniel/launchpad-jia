/**
 * UploadCV Component - Whitecloak Applicant Version
 * 
 * This file now uses the refactored UploadCV component from UploadCV-Refactored.
 * The original 631-line monolithic component has been replaced with a clean import.
 * 
 * Original location: @/lib/components/screen/UploadCV.tsx
 * Refactored location: @/lib/components/UploadCV-Refactored
 * 
 * Note: This is a different context (whitecloak/applicant) from the screens version.
 * If you need the old implementation, check git history.
